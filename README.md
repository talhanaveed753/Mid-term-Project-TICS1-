To run this code, follow the steps outlined below:

Step 1: Ensure that the latest version of python is installed.

Step 2: Create and activate a virtual python environment using the following commands:
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        Once done using this code, use 'deactivate' to deactivate the venv

Step 3: Install fastAPI/uvicorn using the command 'pip install fastapi uvicorn'
        This should install all the required dependencies
        Alternatively, you can use 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

Use 'python -m pip list' to view all the currently installed dependencies
You can view requirements.txt to see all required dependencies

Use 'pip freeze > requirements.txt' command to create a file with all required dependencies
