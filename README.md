To run this code, follow the steps outlined below: <br>

## Step 1: Ensure that the latest version of python is installed. <br>

## Step 2: Create and activate a virtual python environment using the following commands: <br>
        python -m venv venv <br>
        .\venv\Scripts\activate <br>

Once done using this code, use 'deactivate' to deactivate the venv <br>

## Step 3: Install fastAPI/uvicorn <br>
        pip install fastapi uvicorn

This should install all the required dependencies <br>
Alternatively, you can use 'pip install -r requirements.txt' <br>

Use 'python -m pip list' to view all the currently installed dependencies <br>
You can view requirements.txt to see all required dependencies <br>

Use 'pip freeze > requirements.txt' command to create a file with all required dependencies
